# Voice Training Dataset - Metadata Format
# =========================================
#
# This file maps audio clip filenames to their transcriptions.
#
# FORMAT: filename_without_extension|exact_transcription
#
# RULES:
# - Each line contains one clip: clip_XXX|The text that was spoken.
# - Filename should NOT include the .wav extension
# - Transcription must match the spoken audio EXACTLY
# - Include punctuation as appropriate (periods, commas, question marks)
# - Do NOT include filler words unless actually spoken ("um", "uh")
#
# RECORDING TIPS:
# - Keep each clip 3-15 seconds long
# - Record in a quiet room with minimal echo
# - Maintain consistent microphone distance (6-12 inches)
# - Speak naturally at your normal pace
# - Take breaks every 10-15 minutes to avoid fatigue
